# IMAS tools for MUSCLE3
This repository contains helper actors for working with IMAS data in MUSCLE3.
It contains:

* **Data source**: Load and send timeslices from a DBEntry on the `O_I` port.
* **Data sink**: Save timeslices to a DBEntry on the `F_INIT` port.
* **Data sink_source**: Load and send a timeslice from a DBEntry on the `O_F` port based on an incoming timeslice on the `F_INIT` port.
* **Accumulator (buffer) actors**: Gather messages on `S` port and send out the combination on `O_F`.
* **IMAS-Validator actor**: Perform validation checks on data on the `F_INIT` port, generate reports.
