Sink/source actor
=================

Actors for loading and saving generic IMAS data in a simulation. Useful for debugging and testing purposes
when creating simulation workflows, as well as providing starting conditions and saving results for simulations.

Available Operational Modes
---------------------------

  - ***Source actor***: Use an IDS as a data source. Loop over the timestamps and send them out one by one.

  .. code-block:: bash

    implementations:
      source_component:
        executable: python
        args: -u -m imas_muscle3.actors.source_component

  - ***Sink actor***: Use an IDS as a data sink. Saves all incoming data to an IDS.

  .. code-block:: bash

    implementations:
      sink_component:
        executable: python
        args: -u -m imas_muscle3.actors.sink_component

  - ***Combined actor***: Receives data, optionally saves it and sends out preexisting IDS data for the timestamp closest to the incoming timestamp.

  .. code-block:: bash

    implementations:
      sink_source_component:
        executable: python
        args: -u -m imas_muscle3.actors.sink_source_component

Available Settings
------------------

* Mandatory

  - ***sink_uri***: (string) IMAS URI in which to save incoming data. (Only sink and sink_source)
  - ***source_uri***: (string) IMAS URI from which to load data. (Only source and sink_source)

* Optional

  - ***dd_version***: (string) IMAS Data Dictionary version number to which data will be converted. Defaults to original dd_version of the data.
  - ***<ids_name>_occ***: (int) Occurence number to load from or save to for a given ids_name. Replace <ids_name> with the required ids i.e. equilibrium_occ. Defaults to 0.
  - ***t_min***: (float) Minimum time value for loading timeslices. Defaults to None.
  - ***t_max***: (float) Maximum time value for loading timeslices. Defaults to None.
  - ***interpoation_method***: (int) Which IMAS interpolation ethod to use for source. Defaults to CLOSEST_INTERP.

Available Ports
---------------

All IDS's are available for the sink/source actor. They will be active if connected in the ymmsl file and will be skipped otherwise.
The source actor uses only the O_I port. The sink actor uses only the F_INIT port. The combined actor uses the F_INIT and O_F ports.

* Optional

  - ***<ids_name>_in (F_INIT)***: Any incoming IDS's on the F_INIT port. Replace <ids_name> with the required ids i.e. equilibrium_in.
  - ***<ids_name>_out (O_F, O_I)***: Any outgoing IDS's on the O_F and O_I ports. Replace <ids_name> with the required ids i.e. equilibrium_out.

General
-------
The sink/source actor is not bound to a specific DD version.
